		<p> This is a picture of a game called Warframe that I recently have got back into. The game is a free-to-play multiplayer action role-playing third-person shooter. <br>
		I have played this game on and off throughout it's lifetime,usually due to being overwhelmed by the content. The game is getting two big updates this year including a whole new planet.<br>
		so I am preparing myself by playing catch up on the past years.The game has been pretty friendly to a returning player since the community has a bunch of guides on youtube. </p>
