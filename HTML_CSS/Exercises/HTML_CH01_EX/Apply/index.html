	<p> I am using Notepad++ to edit this website.</p>
	
	<p> During chapter 1 I learn about how to properly set plan a website. First you can create a wireframe
		which you can do on a piece of paper.<br>You would create sections on the piece of paper representating 
		the different parts of you website such as a logo,banner,images,text area,etc.<br>Next you would create 
		a site map which will allow you plan out where each link on your site leads to. Using the site map and wireframe<br> 
		will help you figure where to place design elements.Once everything is place you can start the accessibility process.</p>
	
	<p> During chapter 1 I learned about the difference between XHTML and HTML. XHTML is used for transporting and storing data<br>
		while, HTML is used for presenting information instead of storing it.
